File Management

We will be using GitHub for file management and file version.

We will also be holding physical copies of any programming we do just in case an error occurs. Each version will be stored by all of us.

We will also be using Sublime to conduct coding for our project.

Miscellaneous

We agree to communicate effectively and efficiently.

Any missed meeting will be communicated to all group meetings.

Multiple missed meetings will result in consequences. These consequences include bringing a treat for all members.

We will all code and learn the languages needed to complete the project.

If we do not know how to do something, we will do our best to figure it out.

We will ask for help if we get stuck.

We will communicate all problems within a group in a professional manner.
